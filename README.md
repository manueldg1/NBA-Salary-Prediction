NBA Salaries Performance Analysis (2023-2024)
Introduction & Objective
The goal of this project is to investigate whether the salaries earned by NBA players during the 2023-2024 season are fair in proportion to their performance during the Regular Season.

To analyze performance, we selected several statistics:

Common Metrics: Points, rebounds, and assists.

Advanced Metrics: Usage, Player Impact Estimate (PIE), and Win Shares (WS).

Key Goals:
Correlation Analysis: Understand how different statistics correlate with player salaries.

Model Selection: Determine which statistical model best fits the data.

Overpaid/Underpaid Identification: Compare actual salaries with predicted values to identify players who are statistically overpaid or underpaid.

Positional Study: Analyze players by role (Centers, Forwards, and Guards) to construct position-specific models and study the similarities or differences between them.

Steps Followed
To perform our analysis, we followed a structured Data Science workflow:

Data Collection: Automated extraction of player statistics and salary data.

Data Exploration (EDA): Statistical profiling and visualization of the relationships between variables.

Data Analysis and Interpretation: Implementation of regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) and interpretation of the results.
